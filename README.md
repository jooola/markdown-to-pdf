# [Markdown to PDF](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-to-pdf)

Atom package that convert markdown to pdf on the fly.

This package is baseb on the previous [Markdown to PDF package](https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf) maintained by [travs](https://github.com/travs).

## Usage

Just focus the window containing your markdown file and use the `convert` command (`Packages > Markdown to PDF > Convert`) or with the following shortcut `ctrl-alt-e`.

The output PDF will be styled similar to the markdown on `github.com`.

It will appear in the same directory as the Markdown you are converting, with the same name and a `.pdf` extension.

You can set parameters in the package's settings, such as page and border size.
